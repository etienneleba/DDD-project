- Apply the strategic patterns and tactical patterns of domain driven design on a real project
- Use behavioral driven development to understand and clarify the product domain
- Transform the product domain understanding into acceptance tests
- Guide the project with the acceptance tests (acceptance tests driven development)
- Use tests driven development to guide de development and ensure in consequence the non-regression
- Document the project with code based documentation (living documentation)
- Create future-proof and decoupling application thanks to the clean architecture
- Delimit the bounded contexts of the project
